### understanding interactions and flows in philadelphia 

Here we use mobility to model Philadelphia's socio-spatial network: how do neighborhoods in the city interact with each other and how have these interactions changed over time? We use this data to explore which venues or points of interest are shared destinations between different parts of the city, which are locally and which are globally important to the social fabric. We can also track economic activity and probe the changing shape of social contact and social distance throughout this pandemic. A report for the City of Philadelphia can be found [here](https://asrenninger.github.io/philamonitor/).
