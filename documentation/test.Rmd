# Methods

**Line of inquiry:**

+ **Transit:** Where are Philadelphians moving to and from through the City? Where and when are these flows emerging? How do today's flow compare at baseline?
+ **Economy:** What are the emerging centers of economic opportunity over time and how do these clusters compare to baseline?
+ **Risk:** Where are Philadelphians crowding, relative to available space indoors and outdoors?  

## Data

The data that we will use in this study come from `SafeGraph`, a provider of location data, which produces twin datasets---places and patterns---that combine to track the flow of mobile phones between residences and points of interest, like restaurants and bars. This study will focus on Philadelphia and consider the role of location data in aiding its opening as the impact of the novel coronavirus attenuates. Because we want to consider policy in our analysis, the natural unit of area of interest is the City of Philadelphia, which is contains roughly 23 thousand points of interest according to SafeGraph, including 5,100 restaurants---the most common category.

Should we want to expand our aperature to the larger region, Greater Philadelphia spans 11 counties, broken into 4,300 block groups by the Census Bureau. Taking this as our area of interest, there are 98,000 unique points of interest to examine, with predominant categories including restaurants (16,100), doctors (4,800) or dentists (3,100).
