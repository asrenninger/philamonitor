# Methods

**Lines of inquiry:**

+ **Transit:** Where are Philadelphians moving to and from through the City? Where and when are these flows emerging? How do today's flow compare at baseline?
+ **Economy:** What are the emerging centers of economic opportunity over time and how do these clusters compare to baseline?
+ **Risk:** Where are Philadelphians crowding, relative to available space indoors and outdoors?  

## Data

The data that we will use in this study come from **SafeGraph**, a provider of location data, which produces twin datasets---places and patterns---that combine to track the flow of mobile phones between residences and points of interest, like restaurants and bars. This study will focus on Philadelphia and consider the role of location data in aiding its opening as the impact of the novel coronavirus attenuates. Because we want to consider policy in our analysis, the natural unit of area of interest is the City of Philadelphia, which is contains roughly 23 thousand points of interest according to SafeGraph, including 5,100 restaurants---the most common category.

Should we want to expand our aperature to the larger region, Greater Philadelphia spans 11 counties, broken into 4,300 block groups by the Census Bureau. Taking this as our area of interest, there are 98,000 unique points of interest to examine, with predominant categories including restaurants (16,100), doctors (4,800) or dentists (3,100).

## Bias

SafeGraph have attempted to describe the [bias](https://www.safegraph.com/blog/what-about-bias-in-the-safegraph-dataset) of these data, finding that it is generally sampling a population similar to that of the United States according to the Census Bureau. The data come from a panel of 40 million devices, but these are not distributed throughout nation in the same manner as the population: Pennsylvanian devices constitute 3.9% of the 40 million tracked population, but actual Pennsylvanians make up closer to 4% of the 322 million true population. Errors like this permeate all dimensions of the data---demographic and geographic distributions alike. That said, the correlation between devices and persons on measures of education and income is 0.99, aided by the size of the dataset. SafeGraph appears to have made a reasonable attempt create a dataset that maps well to population as a whole. There may, of course, be spatial heterogeneities in this bias---marked in some areas and trivial in others---and we can at least estimate this in our work by comparing the ratio of devices to people across the city.

## Exploration

We can use this data to create matrices of interactions between neighborhoods in Philadlephia, using matrix multiplication to view from either the perspective of the neighborhood or the point of interest; included in the patterns data are the origin block groups. Below we take one area as an example. Near the Delaware River, this section of the city has a Wal-Mart among several other popular chain stores. People visit from across the city, though most people who live here stay here during the day.

Further, also included in the patterns data is the number of visits by hour or by day (though not by hour *and* by day), so we can build spatio-temporal flows. These flows can be compared to a reference, as SafeGraph provides data for 2019 and 2020. Rather than comparing to the exact day in 2019, which would be noisy, we can instead construct representative days of the week by season.     

## Identification

The more challenging task is to determine what constitutes a flow; as we see in the map, many communities in Philadelphia send visitors to many others, but this may not represent strong connection. Again to reduce noise, we can aggregate by day, use week or weekend binaries, and again track changes between seasons. We should, of course, also track changes between mitigation techniques during the pandemic: when citizens are ordered to shelter, their moves should be different than when they are allowed to travel. [This repository](https://github.com/COVID19StatePolicy/SocialDistancing), compiled by academics at the University of Washington, follows progress on this front. 

Each definition of flow will depend on the use case: transit will likely demand week-weekend and peak-nonpeak considerations, so that service may vary. Economic development will explore variations by brand and industry, to identify where experiences are diversifying, where they are simplifying, and where specialist corridors are emerging. As above, we can use matrix manipulations in the same way while filtering for time or brand---or another consideration.
