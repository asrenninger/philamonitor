# Exploration

With the goal of understanding the time-space patterns of resident movement in Philadelphia, the following section presents a series of maps and tables. 

## Points of Interest

We can start by looking at which points of interest were most popular in the beginning of the year and how that is changed in recent months. The table below shows just that, alongside a map that generally conveys that distribution locations across Philadelphia. 

 Rankings             |  Locations

The airport fell in the ranks, though all others saw few visitors in August than in January—even more striking when we consider weather, which could have produced the opposite effect in other years. Malls and shopping centers appear to have weathered the pandemic well, but the shift to remote work should also appear in the data. We can look at visits to the Comcast Center and the Plaza below it; visits in April and May, as the coronavirus took hold in the city, fell to the point of irrelevance.

Yet with offices vacant, parks should have swelled with visitors. We see mixed evidence of this in the data. Philadelphia has four central squares—Rittenhouse, Washington, Logan, and Franklin—which provide important community amenity; all saw fewer visits in April and May than later in the summer, suggesting winter patterns even as the weather improved.

## Aggregations

Perhaps more valuable than probing individual points of interest is aggregating by areal units. Philadelphia has roughly 150 neighborhoods (we use [definitions](https://github.com/azavea/geo-data/tree/master/Neighborhoods_Philadelphia) from local firm Azavea) and each responded differently to the pandemic. Neighborhoods dominated by office work, like the Navy Yard along with Logan Square and Center City, saw precipitous declines in foot traffic, but those with strong amenities and residential communities have recovered. This suggests that demand for food, drink, and shopping may be shifting away from the core. (Note: see the appendix for larger tables.)

Using regular tesselations, we can aggregate to a grid of 500 meter cells to see how this manifests across space. We are still aggregating from points of interest, so this is visits to businesses, parks, museums and the like, but by tile; this does not include visits to the particular patch of land without setting foot in a point of interest. The city hollowed out during the worst months of the pandemic but the Old City, Center City, University City axis still appears to have pockets of thriving activity in these maps.

We can also aggregate by use, grouping by classes like leisure and tourisms. Below we define leisure as visits to restaurants and bars, and see that there are distinct changes in the flow between March and April using a technique called change point detect.
