# Exploration

With the goal of understanding the time-space patterns of resident movement in Philadelphia, the following section presents a series of maps and tables. Note that SafeGraph captures a slice of the population, attempting to monitor a representative sample of the population across the country; that said, we can reduce noise through various aggregations and by tracking trends, which are naturally indexed to population of devices rather than the population as a whole. We definitions specified in the following infographic: the number of visitors is the count of devices flowing to a point of interest—be it from a given Census Block Group or total—while a connection is an origin-destination line between a Census Block Group and a point of interest, regardless of its weight. We use both here to determine how many people are moving about the city and from where to where, which calls to how integrated the city is during the pandemic.

This analysis comprises different scales, each elaborating on distinct aspects of mobility and activity in Philadelphia. We can look *globally*, across the city, to explore trends throughout; we can also think *locally*, dividing the city up into cells or neighborhoods to probe variations within the city. Finally, we can avoid aggregation, looking at individual points or interest or grouping them algorithmically. Below, we attempt to understand the data by engaging them at each scale. 

### Three Units of Analysis

1. [Global, city](#global)
2. [Local, neighborhood](#local)
3. [Point of Interest](#poi)

## global

In this section, we look at trends across the city, beginning with the distribution of venues and businesses across it. We can classify each point of interest by its description. If it contains restuarant or bar, we call that leisure. Anything educational, from tutoring to public, private or charter schools to tertiary education, we call that education. Tourism includes museums and parks.

We can also show how visitation is change across time by tracking footfall across brands. Notice in this animation that dollar stores rise gradually throughout the year, an expected change as residents both need more home goods and need to save money; another important shift is away from non-essential retail towards essential businesses like pharmacies. Starbucks and Wawa occupy top spots for the first several weeks of the year but when the shelter-in-place order sets in, patronage immediately collapses and they are replaced in the ranks essential shops RiteAid and ShopRite.

The table below supports this story, showing that brands associated with necessities (Target and Walmart) are growing in popularily, along with fast food restaurants, which one might expect in a time of constrained budgets. The map explores pairs of like brands and their locations in Philadelphia.

We can also aggregate by use, grouping by classes like leisure and tourism. The pandemic had distinct effects on each class, but particularly leisure—like restaurants and bars—and other; other includes offices which also explains the steep fall. Interestingly, tourism is recovering while shops and grocers are not, perhaps as many switch to digital commerce.

## local

Perhaps more valuable than probing individual points of interest is aggregating by areal units, which we do in this section. Philadelphia has roughly 150 neighborhoods (we use [definitions](https://github.com/azavea/geo-data/tree/master/Neighborhoods_Philadelphia) from local firm Azavea) and each responded differently to the pandemic. Neighborhoods dominated by office work, like the Navy Yard along with Logan Square and Center City, saw precipitous declines in foot traffic, but those with strong amenities and residential communities have recovered. This suggests that demand for food, drink, and shopping may be shifting away from the core. (Note: see the appendix for larger tables.)

Using regular tesselations, we can aggregate to a grid of 500 meter cells to see how this manifests across space. We are still aggregating from points of interest, so this is visits to businesses, parks, museums and the like, but by tile; this does not include visits to the particular patch of land without setting foot in a point of interest. The city hollowed out during the worst months of the pandemic but the Old City, Center City, University City axis still appears to have pockets of thriving activity in these maps.   

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/asrenninger/philamonitor/master/viz/grid.png)

Businesses cluster together and we can explore the strength of this phenomenon by looking at commercial corridors in Philadelphia, of which the city has designated roughly 280. Looking at Night Life, the largest are Market West and Market East, on either side of city hall, with 1712 and 1263 restaurants and bars respectively, following by Old City at 654 and another in University City with 493: most of the business activity is concentrated in a few locales. 

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/asrenninger/philamonitor/master/viz/corridors.png) 

When we plot trends in these clusters over time, it is clear that many of the most successful areas are toward the periphery, perhaps dormitory communities supported by remote work, and several of the least successful are situated in the core.

The relationship between centrality—distance to the Philadelphia's core—and activity is negligible: many corridors in or around Center City did indeed see a decline, but so too did those that likely serve a local clientelle.

## poi

Finally, this section looks at individual points of interest, how they perform over time and how they cluster together to form commmercial corridors. Big box stories appear to have weathered the pandemic well, but the shift to remote work should also appear in the data. We can look at visits to the Comcast Center and the Plaza below it; visits in April and May, as the coronavirus took hold in the city, fell to the point of irrelevance. 

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/asrenninger/philamonitor/master/viz/comcast.png)

Yet with offices vacant, parks should have swelled with visitors. We see mixed evidence of this in the data. Philadelphia has four central squares—Rittenhouse, Washington, Logan, and Franklin—which provide important community amenity; all saw fewer visits in April and May than later in the summer, suggesting winter patterns continued even as the weather improved. As a signal for tourism, we can look at Reading Terminal Market; vendors between its walls saw marked declines in visits beginning in April.

## Anomaly Detection

Below we define leisure as visits to restaurants and bars, and see that there are distinct changes in the flow between March and April using a technique called change point detection. The model does not seem to settle on change points in situations with little change; grocers saw much less change than restaurants and the change points are far less clear, appearing in pairs at each hinge. 

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/asrenninger/philamonitor/master/viz/changepoints.png)

From here, we can fit a similar model to each neighborhood based on the food traffic to that region. We do this by aggregating visits to every point of interest within a given boundary. This means that we are measuring visits to points of interest, not general activity on the streets and in the residences of a neighborhood. Rather than simply flag the change points across time and space, we can instead pull from the model the rate change at regular intervals throughout the period; these changes, rates being the rates of visits, then show the volatility of mobility patterns across time.   

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/asrenninger/philamonitor/master/viz/tracker.gif)

We can see that there is a period of abrupt change in April and May, coinciding with the pandemic but starting later and ending earlier in different neighborhoods. The appendix has a chart that logs each significant change point (above 10 percent change in the trend week-on-week) for each neighborhood, and maps the volatility associated with them for additional clarity.
